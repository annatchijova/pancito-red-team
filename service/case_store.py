"""Case persistence for the analyst workflow.

A *case* is how a real examiner uses annaconda: verdicts for one host
accumulate over time into a single, tamper-evident record that can be
reopened, handed off, and defended later. Each investigation run appends its
sealed windows to the case's chain, continuing it — the whole case remains one
unbroken sealed record from its first window.

Two backends, with honest degradation:
- FirestoreCaseStore: durable, shared across instances (production).
- MemoryCaseStore: in-process fallback used when Firestore is unavailable.

The active backend is reported (health endpoint, UI) — the service never
pretends data is durable when it is not.
