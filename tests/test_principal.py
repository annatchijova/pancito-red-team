"""Who is asking, and whether we actually know.

The catalog gate was only ever as good as the identity in front of it: a
department arriving in a request body is a claim, not a fact. These tests hold
the distinction — an asserted department is allowed by default and recorded as
asserted, a verified identity wins over anything the request claims, and a
deployment can require verification with one env var.
