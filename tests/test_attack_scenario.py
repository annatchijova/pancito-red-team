"""The attack scenario must produce a real MALICE verdict — and only from a
genuine structural fracture, never from an inflated score.

Guards two directions:
- the compromised-endpoint fixtures yield MALICE with the expected fractures
  and MITRE techniques (a real detection, regression-pinned), and
- benign telemetry stays benign even though the adapter now surfaces engine
  fields (the promotion must never fabricate a fracture).
