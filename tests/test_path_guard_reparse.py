"""PathGuard must refuse a path that is redirected out of its allowlist.

The allowlist is evaluated on the LEXICAL path, deliberately: resolving first
would lose the evidence that the path crossed a redirection. That makes the
redirection check the whole of the confinement, so anything the check does not
recognise is a way out of the allowlist.

``is_symlink()`` does not recognise a Windows junction. A junction is a
directory reparse point, any unprivileged user can create one with ``mklink /J``,
and it redirects exactly like a symlink -- but ``Path.is_symlink()`` and
``os.path.islink()`` both return False for it. Nothing else caught it either:
the S_ISREG check passes because the target really is a regular file, and
``O_NOFOLLOW`` does not exist on Windows, so ``safe_open`` has no second line.

Verified on Windows 11 / Python 3.12 before the fix: the file read directly was
rejected OUTSIDE_ALLOWLIST, and the same file reached through a junction planted
inside the allowed directory validated VALID and ``safe_read()`` returned its
contents.

PathGuard guards evidence paths in sift/memory_forensics.py and
sift/registry_timeline_reconstructor.py, whose
comment states "PathGuard sigue rechazando symlinks, TOCTOU" as the reason the
allowlist can be widened safely. These tests exist so that claim is checked on
the platform where it was false, and had no test coverage at all.
