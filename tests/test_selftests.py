"""Pytest wrappers around the module-embedded self-tests.

The historical test suites live inline in their modules (``python3 -m <module>``
runs them). These wrappers make them visible to pytest/CI without rewriting
them. Two honest tiers, kept distinct on purpose:

- ASSERT_SUITES: modules whose __main__ block is a real assert-based suite.
  Passing means "verified correct".
- SMOKE_RUNS: modules whose __main__ block is a smoke run. Passing means only
  "ran without crashing" — weaker, and labeled as such (see CLAUDE.md section
  on honest degradation: a green that cannot distinguish the two is forbidden).

    """Run a module's inline suite, stating the encoding of the channel we judge by.

    ``text=True`` alone decodes with the locale's preferred encoding and lets
    the child inherit the console codepage. That is UTF-8 on Linux and macOS
    but the ANSI codepage on Windows, and these suites print box-drawing
    characters and "✓". The result was a verdict decided by the presentation
    layer: the child died of UnicodeEncodeError before its asserts could run,
    the parent then hit UnicodeDecodeError reading the partial output, and this
    wrapper reported both as "<module> self-test failed" -- a red verdict about
    code that was never executed, which is exactly the collapse this file's
    own docstring forbids.

    ``PYTHONIOENCODING`` fixes the write side and ``encoding`` the read side.
    On POSIX both were already UTF-8, so nothing changes there. Naming the
    codec also removes a locale-dependent decode from the test path.
    ``errors="replace"`` keeps a mangled byte from crashing the reporter; the
    verdict still rests on the exit code and the success marker, never on the
