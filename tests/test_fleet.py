"""The specialized fleet: strictly disjoint tool contracts, verified.

Separation of responsibilities is the thing a fleet is judged on, so it is a
test, not a claim: no tool belongs to two specialists, only the correlator can
reach the sealed core, and the dispatcher orchestrates a real end-to-end
investigation whose verdict the deterministic engine (not any agent) decides.
