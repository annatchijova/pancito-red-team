"""Regression tests for the external red-team (Round 1) findings.

Each test locks in a fix and would fail against the pre-fix code, so a later
change that reopens the hole is caught. The Firestore transactional path (R3-1)
is not covered here — it is a property of the real backend and needs a Firestore
emulator; see docs/RED_TEAM_AUDIT_ROUND1_EXTERNAL.md.
