"""TEMPORAL_CAUSALITY_VIOLATION must pair artifacts that belong together.

The rule reads "network activity happened before the process that caused it".
Deciding that requires knowing the network event and the process are the same
execution -- otherwise any host whose oldest connection predates its newest
process (that is: every host) fabricates a severity-1.0 fracture whose text
claims "the originating process" about two unrelated PIDs.

This was invisible while the only telemetry carrying the structured event
times was a fixture annotating exactly one hand-picked pair. It surfaces the
moment real Velociraptor rows carry their own event times.

Doctrine followed here, matching the rule's existing M1 comment:
  - two KNOWN and different PIDs are a determinate answer ("not the same
    execution"), so the pair is simply not evaluated and nothing is recorded;
  - a MISSING PID is decision-relevant missing data, so the pair is recorded
    in temporal_pairs_skipped rather than silently treated either way.
