"""The independent exhibit verifier confirms good seals and catches tampering.

Two things are proved here. First, that the standalone verifier
(tools/verify_bundle.py) agrees with a genuinely sealed chain and rejects every
class of tampering. Second — and this is what makes it worth anything — that its
OWN copy of the canonical encoder is bit-for-bit in lockstep with the producer's
(core/canonicalize.py). If the two ever drift, the verifier would stop being an
independent check and this test fails.
