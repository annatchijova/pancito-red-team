"""The autonomous cycle: real agency over the investigation, none over the verdict.

These tests run the unattended path end to end with no model reachable, so what
they exercise is the deterministic fallback planner driving the *same* tool
contract the Gemini commander drives. What is being proven is structural and
holds for both planners: the commander cannot collect or adjudicate itself, the
catalog refuses taskings outside its department, memory carries across cycles,
and the verdict comes from the sealed engine.
