"""Velociraptor adapter: VQL hunt results -> sealed evidence windows.

Boundary layer between the live evidence source (Velociraptor, independent
AGPLv3 service reached over its API) and the deterministic core. It does
three things, and deliberately nothing more:

1. Collect: run curated VQL templates (vql_templates.py) through a transport.
2. Normalize: turn result rows into the artifact shape the core scorer
   already consumes. The adapter assigns NO scores — ``raw_score`` is left
   absent so the core applies its own defaults; scoring is decision-path
   work and the adapter is not on the decision path for values, only for
   evidence custody.
3. Freeze: build an immutable evidence window (contracts/
   evidence_window.schema.json) whose ``window_hash`` uses the same
   canonical-v2 + SHA-256 recipe as the core bundle seal.

Determinism rules honored here:
- No wall clock anywhere in a hashed payload: the caller supplies the
  window time bounds; artifact timestamps come from the collected rows.
- Artifact ids derive from row content (SHA-256), so window hashes are
  independent of row arrival order.
- Same fixtures in, bit-identical window out, in any process.

    The boundary used to accept a declared event time only when it was already
    a non-empty ``str``. That is a type check on the carrier, not a reading of
    the value, and it silently cost real evidence: a live Windows collection
    lost ALL 48 of its process-creation events (Event ID 4688) because
    ``parse_evtx()`` returns ``System.TimeCreated.SystemTime`` as a float epoch
    while ``pslist()`` returns ``CreateTime`` as an ISO string. Same collector,
    two representations of a time, one accepted -- and the rejected one is the
    only source of real process-creation times in the whole template set.

    A numeric epoch is therefore converted here, at the boundary, which is what
    normalization is for. No float is sealed and no float arithmetic enters the
    decision path: the conversion happens BEFORE the window is built and what
    gets canonicalized and hashed is the resulting string, deterministically
    derived from the same input on any machine.

    Seconds-versus-milliseconds cannot be told apart from the number alone, so
    the interpretation is checked instead of assumed: a converted value that
    lands outside the plausible forensic window is reported unusable rather
    than recorded. A millisecond epoch read as seconds falls in 1970 and is
    caught by exactly that test.

    Strings pass through untouched, including sentinel epochs. That asymmetry
    is deliberate: a string is a claim the collector already committed to and
    we record it as given (the window's own bounds exclude sentinels from the
    coverage it declares), whereas a number forces US to choose a reading, and
    an implausible result means our reading is not safe to record.
