"""Where the Velociraptor binary is, for the machine actually running.

The release asset name was hardcoded to ``linux-amd64`` in both the live test
and the live validation script. On any other platform that made the suite report
"Velociraptor binary not present" while the correct signed binary sat in the
directory it was looking in -- a lookup bug that reads as an environment gap,
which is worse than a failure: it makes a platform look untested when it was
merely unlooked-at.

Kept here, next to the adapter, because the test and validation script both need
it and a helper shared by two callers should not live inside either of them.
