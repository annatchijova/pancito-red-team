# Attributions

PANCITO-RED-TEAM builds on pre-existing and third-party work. This file
discloses what was incorporated, per the disclosure requirement of the All
Things Agentic Hackathon (Google/Gemini): pre-existing code may be used as a
foundation provided the submission discloses it and demonstrably builds upon
it.

The line between pre-existing and new: the **deterministic forensic core** is
prior work (VIGÍA, below); everything that makes annaconda a live, agentic,
Google-Cloud purple-team tool was **built for this submission** and is listed
under "New in this submission".

## Repository licensing scope

Original PANCITO-RED-TEAM work is offered under PolyForm Strict 1.0.0. That
license does not replace or narrow rights already granted for inherited and
third-party material. The VIGÍA/annaconda portions identified below retain
their [Apache-2.0 terms](LICENSES/Apache-2.0.txt), Camel-derived material
retains its [MIT terms](LICENSES/Camel-MIT.txt), and Velociraptor remains a
separate AGPLv3 program. See each upstream project for additional notices.

## Prior work — the deterministic core (Apache-2.0)

### VIGÍA
<https://github.com/annatchijova/vigia-intent-analysis>

A deterministic forensic-intent engine (Peircean semiotics, Daubert-oriented),
originally built for the SANS FIND EVIL hackathon — pre-dates this submission.
annaconda uses it as its sealed decision core. Incorporated subsystems:

- The deterministic scorer (`vigia_scorer.py`) and its dependency closure:
  canonical serialization (`core/canonicalize.py`), evidence aggregation, the
  decision/risk-bounded layers, likelihood/calibration, bundle sealing, graph
  stability.
- **CAIE — the Cross-Artifact Incongruence Engine (`tools/caie.py`)**: the
  cross-artifact fracture detectors (temporal-causality, process-injection,
  log-vs-memory, etc.) that produce the sealed verdicts annaconda demonstrates,
  and the MITRE ATT&CK mapping (`tools/mitre_mapping.py`).
- The 8-state quadripartite verdict (`verdict/quadripartite.py`) and the
  abductive reasoner (`inference/`).
- The SIFT analyzer suite (`sift/`) and the compatibility shim
  (`sift_orchestrator_shim.py`).
- The security / Model Armor layer (`security/`): LLMShield (prompt-injection
  firewall), sandboxed subprocess execution, path/output boundary validation.
- The LLM hallucination guard (`core/hallucination_guard.py`) — narrative
  claims mechanically verified against the sealed motor output.

This is the majority of the ~38 KLOC in the repository. It is disclosed here in
full; annaconda's own new code is listed separately below so a reviewer can draw
the line without guessing.

Other prior projects (CRONOS, MNEME, raven-memory, MUTANTE) are **not** included
in this submission and are not imported by any module here.

### Protocol Kassandra — VIGÍA lineage (Apache-2.0)

`agent/kassandra.py` is a PANCITO-RED-TEAM adaptation of the semantic-tripwire design
from the author's VIGÍA repository. The adaptation deliberately changes the
contract: Kassandra reports only evidence-to-LLM channel integrity and cannot
produce a forensic verdict. It also uses domain-separated HMAC derivations,
content-bound heartbeat state, exact external response verification, and a
separate HMAC event chain.

## New in this submission (built for this hackathon)

Everything that turns the deterministic core into a live, agentic, cloud tool:

- **Two Google ADK + Gemini agents** (`agent/`): the investigator that drives
  the hunt loop (`purple_team_agent.py`, `tools.py`) and the mentor for junior
  examiners (`consult_agent.py`, `consult_tools.py`). Neither can alter a
  sealed verdict.
- **The Velociraptor adapter** (`tools/velociraptor/`): curated VQL templates,
  Mock/Rest/Query transports, and sealed evidence windows.
- **The hash-chained sealed verdict stream** (`core/verdict_stream.py`) — the
  tamper-evident chain that makes a case one continuing record.
- **The Cloud Run service** (`service/`): FastAPI backend, the Firestore-backed
  case store (`case_store.py`), the analyst console and court-exhibit UI, the
  prompt-injection defense demo, and the autonomous sweep
  (Cloud Scheduler → Pub/Sub → `/tasks/sweep`).
- **The ML triage nominator** (`ml/nominator.py`) — see the Camel attribution
  below.
- The ABSTAIN-as-memory / autonomous-reentry logic, and the determinism and
  contract test suites (`tests/`).

## Third-party open source

### Velociraptor — AGPLv3
<https://github.com/Velocidex/velociraptor>

DFIR endpoint platform (VQL hunts). Used as an **independent service reached
over its own API / binary** — never modified, embedded, or forked — so its
AGPLv3 copyleft does not extend to annaconda's Apache-2.0 code. The official
signed release binary is fetched and GPG-verified by
`scripts/setup_velociraptor.sh`.

### Camel — MIT
<https://github.com/allisterb/Camel>

`ml/nominator.py` is a stdlib-Python port of Camel's label-free surprisal
ensemble (C#, MIT, © 2026 Allister Beharry), adapted to endpoint telemetry
(rare-path, rare-destination, content-entropy detectors retained; the name/type
detectors dropped as noise for this data). The nominator **nominates only** — it
never produces a sealed value.

### Strix — architectural reference only (Apache-2.0)

<https://github.com/usestrix/strix>

PANCITO-RED-TEAM borrows the product discipline of validating security findings with
reproducible evidence and using a bounded catalogue of capabilities. No Strix
source code is copied or imported. PANCITO-RED-TEAM does not inherit Strix's general
shell, browser, exploit, or post-exploitation surface; its current offensive
executor is replay-only and Blue-directed.

## Models

Gemini 3.5 (via Vertex AI) narrates and drives the agents; Gemma
(`gemma-4-26b-a4b-it`, via the Gemini Developer API) is the naive narrator in the
prompt-injection demo. No model is in the decision path — the verdict is sealed
by the deterministic core before any model runs.
