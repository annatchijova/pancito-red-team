# AGENTS.md — working in the PANCITO-RED-TEAM repo

Guidance for any AI coding agent (Claude Code, Cursor, or otherwise) with write
access here. It tells you how to build, run, and test the project, and — more
importantly — the invariants you must not break. Read this before you touch code.
The user-facing story is in `README.md`; the deploy runbook is in `DEPLOY.md`.

## What this is

annaconda is a live purple-team DFIR backend: it analyzes an endpoint as an
attack unfolds and seals a reproducible, MITRE-mapped verdict a court could
trust. A fleet of Google ADK + Gemini agents works cases **unattended** (choosing
what to hunt, carrying a case's memory across weeks, escalating to a human when
needed) — **but the language model is out of the decision path.**

PANCITO-RED-TEAM adds an offensive-validation surface with one non-negotiable scope:
every action exists to test a Blue control on an explicitly authorized target.
Do not add free-form shell, payload, exploit, jailbreak, arbitrary URL/host, or
model-authored execution. Offensive capabilities enter through a deterministic
catalog and an authorization gate, and produce reproducible evidence receipts.

Protocol Kassandra protects evidence-to-LLM channels but remains outside the
forensic decision path. Its status is channel integrity only. Never translate a
tripwire event into MALICE/BENIGN, a score, confidence, MITRE mapping, or a
sealed value. When `VIGIA_ENFORCE_KASSANDRA_SALT=true`, missing
`KASSANDRA_SALT` must prevent startup.

## The one invariant (do not break this)

**A language model never touches the verdict.** This is the founding design
choice, not a preference. Every change you make must preserve it:

1. **The LLM does not decide.** The deterministic core (`core/`) scores the
   evidence and **seals** the result with SHA-256 *before* any agent is called.
   An agent's tools give it **no way to pass a score, a state, or a hash** — it
   may choose *what to investigate* and *put the result into words*, nothing
   more. If you add a tool, it must not let the model supply or suppress a
   sealed value.
2. **No floats, no black-box dependencies, in any sealed value.** The sealed
   core is **stdlib-only** and uses exact arithmetic (`fractions.Fraction`,
   integers). A float or a third-party call anywhere in the decision/seal path
   is a determinism defect — the seals must reproduce **bit-for-bit** across
   fresh processes (different `PYTHONHASHSEED`). `tests/test_determinism.py`
   guards this; it must stay green.
3. **Everything sealed is hash-chained.** Verdicts and mission memory each seal
   a new entry onto the previous one with the same canonical SHA-256 recipe;
   reads re-verify the chain. Never write a sealed value outside a chain, and
   never let a chain be truncated in a way an attacker could also truncate
   (`service/chain_store.py` stores bounded segments for exactly this reason).
4. **Honest degradation.** When something can't be guaranteed, say so, don't
   fake it: Firestore → in-memory is announced on `/health`; a partial
   collection yields `ABSTAIN` (a first-class verdict) with *what evidence would
   resolve it*, not a false BENIGN; a failed collection is recorded as
   unobserved, never as "looked at and found quiet".

If a change would put the model, a float, or a black-box dependency near a
sealed value, it is wrong regardless of how much cleaner it looks.

## Setup, run, test

Python 3.12. The sealed core needs no third-party packages; the service and
agents do.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the backend locally:
export GEMINI_API_KEY=...              # ONLY for agent/mentor narration turns
uvicorn service.app:app --port 8080    # http://localhost:8080
```

Without a Gemini key the deterministic paths still work (scripted investigations,
sealing, replay); only the agent narration needs the model. Without Firestore
credentials the case store degrades to in-memory and reports it on `/health`.

```bash
# Tests (pytest >= 8, testpaths = tests):
pip install pytest && python3 -m pytest

# Prove the reproducibility guarantee explicitly:
python3 -m pytest tests/test_determinism.py -q
```

The load-bearing test: the same case scored in two fresh processes with different
`PYTHONHASHSEED` produces byte-identical seals. Keep it that way.

## Repo map

## Deploying

The service is `vigia-live` on Cloud Run in project **`vigia-497422`**, region
`us-central1`. Follow `DEPLOY.md` exactly. Two non-obvious gotchas that will
silently break a recording if you miss them:

- **`GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` is not injected by Cloud Run.** The case store reads
  it to reach Firestore; without it the store degrades to memory and the fleet's
  continuity claim stops being true. Always pass it in `--set-env-vars`, and
  **confirm `/health` says `"case_store":"firestore"`** before recording.
- **Gemini 3.x on Vertex is served from `global`, not a region.** Set
  `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=global` (the Cloud Run service still lives in
  `us-central1`); a regional value yields a 404.

The autonomous sweep is Cloud Scheduler → Pub/Sub → `POST /tasks/sweep`. A case
created via `POST /cases` is due immediately, so it is worked on the next sweep.

## Before you commit

- [ ] The change keeps the model, floats, and black-box deps out of every sealed
      value (the one invariant).
- [ ] `python3 -m pytest` is green — especially `test_determinism.py`.
- [ ] New sealed data is hash-chained and re-verified on read; degradation is
      honest and surfaced on `/health`.
- [ ] Comments, docstrings, and commit messages are in English; the commit
      message says *why*.
- [ ] Git is forward-only (`commit` / `merge` / `revert`); no `rebase`,
      `squash`, or force-push. Verify repo state with `git status` / `git log`
      before claiming anything about it.
