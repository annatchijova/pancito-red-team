# PANCITO-RED-TEAM — Google Cloud deployment

Step-by-step spin-up for the live purple-team backend on Google Cloud Run.
This is the deployed backend the demo video shows running on Google Cloud.

## What runs where

- **Cloud Run** (`pancito-red-team`, region `us-central1`) hosts the FastAPI backend
  (`service/app.py`): the deterministic forensic core + the ADK agent behind
  an HTTP API.
- **Vertex AI** serves Gemini 3.5 Flash to the ADK agent, through the Cloud
  Run service identity — no API key stored in the service.
- The verdict is sealed by the deterministic core, never by Gemini. Swapping
  the model changes only the narration.

Three mandatory hackathon boxes, all checked: Gemini 3.5+ (Vertex AI), a
Google Agent Framework (ADK), and a Google Cloud service (Cloud Run).

## Prerequisites

- A Google Cloud project with billing (`vigia-497422`).
- Enabled APIs: `run`, `aiplatform`, `cloudbuild`, `artifactregistry`,
  `firestore`, and — for the autonomous sweep — `pubsub` and
  `cloudscheduler`.
  ```bash
  gcloud services enable run.googleapis.com aiplatform.googleapis.com \
      cloudbuild.googleapis.com artifactregistry.googleapis.com \
      firestore.googleapis.com pubsub.googleapis.com \
      cloudscheduler.googleapis.com secretmanager.googleapis.com \
      --project vigia-497422
  ```
- A Firestore database, because that is where a case's mission memory and its
  two hash chains live between cycles. Without one the service still starts —
  it degrades to memory and logs that it did — but nothing survives a restart,
  which is exactly the claim the fleet rests on.
  ```bash
  gcloud firestore databases create --location nam5 --project vigia-497422
  ```
- A private Kassandra salt in Secret Manager. Do not put the salt directly in
  a shell history, Cloud Run command line, image, or repository:
  ```bash
  openssl rand -hex 32 | gcloud secrets create pancito-kassandra-salt \
    --data-file=- --replication-policy=automatic --project vigia-497422
  ```
  Grant the Cloud Run runtime service account
  `roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor` on that secret before deployment.

## Deploy

```bash
gcloud run deploy pancito-red-team \
  --source . \
  --region us-central1 \
  --allow-unauthenticated \
  --memory 1Gi --cpu 1 --timeout 300 \
  --set-env-vars GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=vigia-497422,\
GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=TRUE,GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=global,\
VIGIA_ENFORCE_KASSANDRA_SALT=true \
  --set-secrets KASSANDRA_SALT=pancito-kassandra-salt:latest \
  --project vigia-497422
```

Do not reuse the existing `vigia-live` service name: PANCITO-RED-TEAM is a separate
lineage and must not replace the deployed annaconda/VIGÍA service implicitly.
After deployment, `/health` must report both `"case_store":"firestore"` and
`"kassandra":{"posture":"protected"}` before any evidence-to-model traffic.

### Gotcha: `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` is not set for you

Cloud Run injects `PORT`, `K_SERVICE` and friends, but **not**
`GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`. The case store reads it to reach Firestore, and when it
is absent the store degrades to memory rather than guessing — honestly, with a
warning in the log, but a service that looks healthy. The symptom on camera is
`/health` reporting `"case_store": "memory"`, mission memory that resets on
every cold start, and a fleet that cannot claim continuity across weeks.
Set it explicitly, as above, and confirm on `/health` before recording.

### Gotcha: Vertex location for Gemini 3.x is `global`, not a region

Gemini 3.x publisher models are served on Vertex AI's **`global`** endpoint,
not regional ones. `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=us-central1` yields a 404
(`Publisher model ... was not found`). Set `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=global`
(the Cloud Run service itself still lives in `us-central1`). To change it on
an existing service without a rebuild:
```bash
gcloud run services update pancito-red-team --region us-central1 \
  --update-env-vars GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=global --project vigia-497422
```

## Hardening notes (external red-team Round 1)

See `docs/RED_TEAM_AUDIT_ROUND1_EXTERNAL.md` for the full audit. The P1/P2 findings
are fixed in code. Two P3 items are operational and left to the deployment:

- **Rate limiting is global per endpoint, not per client** (R1-3). One caller can
  exhaust an endpoint's quota for everyone on that instance. For a public demo,
  either raise `VIGIA_RATE_MAX` / `VIGIA_RATE_WINDOW_S`, or front the service with a
  per-client limiter. The model-touching routes (`/consult`, `/tasks/sweep`,
  `/investigate`, `/cases/{id}/cycle`) are all rate-limited; the caller-controlled
  `session_id` is bounded.
- **In-memory growth** (R1-4): per-investigation tempdirs and `_STORE` are not
  reaped. On Cloud Run they reset when the instance recycles; for a long-lived
  instance, restart periodically or add a reaper. No attacker-controlled unbounded
  growth remains (the `session_id` cap closed that).

## Endpoints

Live URL: use the URL returned by the `pancito-red-team` deployment. This
repository does not claim that PANCITO-RED-TEAM is already deployed.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| GET | `/health` | liveness + model/build info |
| GET | `/hunts` | the curated VQL hunts available |
| POST | `/investigate` | run an investigation (mode `scripted` or `agent`) |
| GET | `/investigations/{id}` | fetch a stored investigation |
| GET | `/investigations/{id}/stream` | sealed verdict entries (chain re-verified on read) |

Scripted (no LLM, deterministic — the replay/dashboard path):
```bash
curl -s -X POST "$URL/investigate" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"case_id":"DEMO-001","examiner_id":"purple-op-01","mode":"scripted"}'
```

Agent (Gemini drives the hunt and narrates the sealed verdict):
```bash
curl -s -X POST "$URL/investigate" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"case_id":"DEMO-001","examiner_id":"purple-op-01","mode":"agent",
       "prompt":"Run a baseline sweep, adjudicate it, give the sealed verdict."}'
```

## Autonomous operation (runs without a human, and decides while it runs)

Cloud Scheduler publishes to a Pub/Sub topic on a cron; a push subscription
delivers to `/tasks/sweep`, which wakes the fleet. Every case that is *due* gets
one autonomous cycle: the commander reads the case's mission memory, tasks the
specialists it is cleared to task, adjudicates through the deterministic engine,
and sets its own next wake-up.

The cron is only the wake-up — the cadence is per case, decided by the fleet, so
a 15-minute schedule does not mean a 15-minute collection interval on every
host. One wake-up runs at most `VIGIA_SWEEP_MAX_CYCLES` cycles (default 10),
worst sealed verdict first, deferring the rest to the next one; raise it if your
fleet is larger than your cron is frequent. `/health` reports `autonomous_sweeps`, `autonomous_cycles`,
`cases_worked_last_sweep`, `cases_not_due_last_sweep` and `escalations_raised`.

To watch one cycle without waiting for the cron, use `/fleet-console`, or:

```bash
curl -X POST "$URL/cases/<case-id>/cycle" -H 'content-type: application/json' \
     -d '{"department":"incident-response"}'
curl "$URL/cases/<case-id>/mission"      # the memory it left for the next cycle
```

## Pushing sealed verdicts to Google SecOps (Chronicle) over Pub/Sub

On every sealed escalation (and on demand via `POST /cases/{id}/push-to-secops`)
the case's STIX 2.1 bundle is published to a Pub/Sub topic a Chronicle feed can
subscribe to. It is downstream of the seal: a delivery failure is reported, never
discards the sealed verdict. Without the topic env var — or the client — the
pusher is honestly `unavailable` on `/health`, so the feature is off by default.

To turn it on, create the topic, let the Cloud Run service account publish to it,
and point the service at it (no rebuild needed — the `google-cloud-pubsub` client
is already in `requirements.txt`):

```bash
TOPIC=annaconda-sealed-verdicts
SA=1028999311218-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com   # the Cloud Run runtime SA
gcloud pubsub topics create $TOPIC --project vigia-497422
gcloud pubsub topics add-iam-policy-binding $TOPIC --project vigia-497422 \
  --member="serviceAccount:$SA" --role="roles/pubsub.publisher"
# Point Chronicle's feed at a subscription on $TOPIC; for a smoke test, a pull one:
gcloud pubsub subscriptions create annaconda-secops-demo --topic $TOPIC --project vigia-497422

gcloud run services update pancito-red-team --region us-central1 --project vigia-497422 \
  --update-env-vars SECOPS_PUBSUB_TOPIC=$TOPIC
```

Confirm `/health` reports `"secops_push": "pubsub:annaconda-sealed-verdicts"`, then
`POST /cases/DEMO-CRON-01/push-to-secops` and pull the subscription to see the
STIX bundle arrive with `format=stix-2.1` / `worst_verdict` attributes.

## Seeding enrichment with the organization's own MISP / OpenCTI feed

A window's indicators are matched against the team's own intel and the matches are
sealed *beside* the evidence (never among it, so they cannot move a verdict). Point
`MISP_FEED_PATH` at a MISP attribute export / OpenCTI observable export
(`{"indicators": [{type, value, threat_level_id, tags, event_info, event_id}, ...]}`);
absent, `/health` reports `"misp_feed": "unavailable"`.

The image ships a clearly-labelled demonstration feed
(`demo/misp_demo_feed.json`, → `/app/demo/misp_demo_feed.json`) whose indicators
match the bundled attack scenario, so the enrichment is visible without a real MISP:

```bash
gcloud run services update pancito-red-team --region us-central1 --project vigia-497422 \
  --update-env-vars MISP_FEED_PATH=/app/demo/misp_demo_feed.json
```

Confirm `/health` reports `"misp_feed": "misp:3"`, then
`POST /fleet-investigate {"scenario":"attack"}` and read the `threat-intel` step in
`fleet_log`: `misp_matches` is 3 on the attack window, 0 on the persistence window,
and `worst_verdict` stays `MALICE_HIGH` — the match informs a human, it does not
decide. In production, swap the path for your real org export.

```bash
gcloud pubsub topics create annaconda-sweeps --project <project>
gcloud pubsub subscriptions create annaconda-sweep-push \
  --topic annaconda-sweeps --push-endpoint "$URL/tasks/sweep" \
  --ack-deadline 120 --project <project>
gcloud scheduler jobs create pubsub annaconda-sweeper --location us-central1 \
  --schedule "*/15 * * * *" --topic annaconda-sweeps --message-body "sweep" \
  --project <project>
# trigger on demand for a demo (Pub/Sub push has a few seconds of latency):
gcloud scheduler jobs run annaconda-sweeper --location us-central1 --project <project>
```

## Requiring a verified identity

By default a tasking may *assert* its department, and every cycle records that
it was asserted. To require a verified Google identity token instead:

```bash
gcloud run services update pancito-red-team --region us-central1 \
  --set-env-vars VIGIA_REQUIRE_AUTHENTICATED_PRINCIPAL=true,\
VIGIA_DEPARTMENT_ROSTER="analyst@example.com:soc,ir-lead@example.com:incident-response",\
VIGIA_EXPECTED_AUDIENCE="$URL"
```

`VIGIA_EXPECTED_AUDIENCE` is **required** for a token to authenticate at all:
without it the `aud` claim is not checked, so a token minted for another service
would verify. An asserted principal is then refused with 403. A verified
identity wins over whatever the request body claims, so a SOC token cannot run
as forensics. Give
the Pub/Sub push subscription an OIDC token (`--push-auth-service-account`) and
roster that service account, so the cron runs authenticated too. `/health`
reports `requires_authenticated_principal`.

## Known considerations

- The service is deployed `--allow-unauthenticated` for the demo. Agent-mode
  requests trigger billed Vertex calls, so add authentication or rate limiting
  before sharing the URL widely.
- State lives in Firestore whenever `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` is set and the
  database is reachable; otherwise the service says so on `/health`
  (`"case_store": "memory"`) and keeps running without durability. The two hash
  chains are stored in bounded segments, so a long-running case is not capped
  by Firestore's 1 MiB per-document limit — which a host under an adjudicated
  malicious verdict, re-checked hourly, would otherwise reach in about eleven
  days.
- Demo evidence is bundled (`tests/fixtures/velociraptor`); swap in the live
  Velociraptor `RestTransport` once a lab endpoint exists.
