"""Deterministic tool layer for the annaconda purple-team agent.

These are the functions the ADK agent is allowed to call. They are plain,
type-hinted, docstring'd Python (ADK introspects the signatures and docstrings
to build the tool schema Gemini sees) and they import nothing from ADK or
Gemini — so the whole layer is testable offline and deterministically.

The security stance is encoded in the signatures, not in a prompt:
- The agent can only NAME curated hunts (validated against the VQL registry);
  it cannot author VQL or pass a raw query.
- The agent cannot pass a score, a verdict, or a hash anywhere. Adjudication
  runs the deterministic core and SEALS the result; the tool re-verifies the
  seal before returning, so a model that tried to fabricate is overruled by
  the seal, not trusted.
- Every tool call is appended to an in-session audit trail (chain of custody
  of the investigation itself).

One PurpleTeamSession instance holds the state for one investigation; its
bound methods are handed to the ADK Agent as tools.
