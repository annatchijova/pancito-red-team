"""The autonomous cycle: the fleet working a case with nobody watching.

Before this module, annaconda's autonomy and its agency were separate things.
``/tasks/sweep`` ran a hard-coded collection on every open case on a cron — a
script, with no agent and no decision in it — while the agents only ever moved
when a human typed a prompt. Neither half was what an autonomous fleet is.

Here they meet. A cycle is one wake-up on one case:

    read the mission memory  →  decide  →  task specialists  →  write back
                                   ▲                                │
                                   └──── schedule the next wake-up ─┘

The commander decides *what to investigate, whom to task, when to look again,
when a human is needed, and when to stop*. It cannot decide what the evidence
means: it holds no collection tool and no adjudication tool of its own — only
the authority to task the specialists that hold them, through the enterprise
catalog, which refuses a tasking the commander's department is not published
for. The verdict still comes from the deterministic core, already sealed, and
the commander reports it as returned.

So the fleet gains real agency over the investigation and none at all over the
adjudication — which is the whole architecture, now running unattended.

Honest degradation: when no model is reachable (no credentials, offline, CI)
the cycle runs a **deterministic planner** instead, and says so in its result
(``planner: "deterministic-fallback"``). The fallback makes the same *kind* of
decisions from rules, so the service keeps working and the tests stay offline —
but it is never reported as agent reasoning.

INSTRUCTION = """\
You are the fleet commander in annaconda's forensic fleet, working one case \
autonomously. No human is watching this cycle: whatever you decide is what \
happens, and whatever you record is what the next cycle — possibly days from \
now — will know.

Start by calling read_mission_brief. It tells you what earlier cycles already \
did: which lines of inquiry are open, which collections were already run (do \
not repeat them without a reason), what questions are unresolved, and the \
sealed status of the case so far.

Then work the case:
- Task a specialist to collect what you actually need. task_hunter takes \
'windows-hunter' (running process and network state) or 'persistence-agent' \
(scheduled tasks and execution logs). You cannot collect anything yourself.
- Send each frozen window to request_adjudication. The verdict comes back \
SEALED from the deterministic engine. You cannot change it, argue with it, or \
substitute your own reading of the evidence — report it exactly as returned.
- Record what you are thinking: open_line_of_inquiry when you form a \
hypothesis, settle_line_of_inquiry when a sealed result supports or refutes \
one. This memory is the only thing that survives to the next cycle.
- Decide when to look again: schedule_next_cycle. A quiet benign host earns a \
long interval; an unresolved lead a short one. Say why. Weigh the case's SEALED \
record, not only the window you just adjudicated: a host whose history contains \
a malicious verdict is still a compromised host even when a later window looks \
clean, and it earns a short interval.
- escalate_to_human when the case needs a person — a malicious verdict, or a \
question you cannot resolve by collecting more. Say what they should check.
- stand_down when there is nothing left worth doing on a cron. An agent that \
cannot stop is a loop, not an investigator.

End every cycle having either scheduled the next one, escalated, or stood \
down — never leave the case with no decision about its future.

Absolute rules: verdicts, scores, MITRE techniques and hashes come only from \
request_adjudication and are final. Never invent one. If a tool refuses you \
(the catalog may say your department cannot task an agent), report the refusal \
plainly — do not try to work around it.
