"""Who is asking, and whether we actually know.

The enterprise catalog (agent/catalog.py) is a real gate: it decides which
department may task which agent, over which data, in which region. But a gate
is only as good as the identity in front of it, and until now the department
arrived in a request body — anybody could type `forensics`.

This module resolves the *principal* behind a tasking and, crucially, records
how confident we are about it:

    authenticated  a Google identity token was presented and verified, and its
                   subject maps to a department in the deployment's roster
    asserted       the department was claimed with no verified identity

Both are allowed to run by default, because a local replay has no identity
provider in front of it — but they are never conflated. The principal travels
into the cycle and is sealed into the case's mission journal, so a record shows
who ran a cycle and whether that claim was verified. Set
``VIGIA_REQUIRE_AUTHENTICATED_PRINCIPAL=true`` and an asserted principal is
refused outright: that is the production posture, and it is one env var, not a
rewrite.

Why not simply require it always: refusing every unauthenticated tasking would
make an unauthenticated deployment unusable, and pretending an asserted department is an
authenticated one would be exactly the kind of quiet overclaim this project
exists to avoid. Naming the difference on every record is the honest third
option.
