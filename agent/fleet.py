"""A specialized agent fleet with strictly disjoint tool contracts.

Where the single investigator (agent/purple_team_agent.py) holds every tool,
the fleet splits the work across specialists, each owning a bounded set of
tools that no other specialist shares. That separation of responsibilities is
the thing a fleet is judged on, and it is enforced structurally — a test
asserts the contracts are pairwise disjoint — not just asserted in prose.

Roles:
  dispatcher        triages the case and routes work (sees the hunt catalogue)
  windows-hunter    collects running process + network state
  persistence-agent collects the persistence surface (scheduled tasks, exec logs)
  correlator        adjudicates frozen windows and verifies the sealed chain

Only the correlator's tools reach the deterministic core, and even they cannot
change a verdict — adjudicate runs the sealed engine. The invariant holds across
the fleet: agents act and divide the labour; the engine decides.

The single-investigator route is untouched; the fleet is additive.
